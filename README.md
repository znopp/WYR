# WYR

Would you rather...?

---

WYR is a Discord bot that attempts to fill a gap in the current
bot market: Something that doesn't require user intervention to work!

## Planned Features

- [x] Randomly send a question, but don't send it again
until all other questions have been sent


- [x] Automatically sends a question if there have been x messages sent since the previous question
AND if the time since the bots last message is over x minutes


- [ ] WYR question will be an embed with 2 buttons, one for each option.

  - [ ] Message will be deleted after x seconds, new message will send showing
  total voters, how many votes for each option, and results in percentages.

    
## Potential Future Features

For now, there are no other features planned.
