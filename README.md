# WYR

Would you rather...?

---

WYR is a Discord bot that attempts to fill a gap in the current
bot market: Something that doesn't require user intervention to work!

## Planned Features

- [x] Randomly send a question, but don't send it again
until all other questions have been sent


- [x] Automatically sends a question if there have been x messages sent since the previous question
AND if the time since the bots last message is over x minutes


- [x] WYR question will be an embed with 2 buttons, one for each option.

  - [x] Message will be deleted after x seconds, new message will send showing
  total voters, how many votes for each option, and results in percentages.


- [x] Import a lot of WYR questions... using Chat-GPT!

    
## Potential Future Features

- [x] Add slash commands for:
  - Adding a channel to list of allowed channels the bot will send a message in
  - Removing a channel, for the same purpose.
  - Adding a WYR question to the JSON list


- [x] Set permissions for slash commands

For now, there are no other features planned.

I hope this list stays empty forever.
